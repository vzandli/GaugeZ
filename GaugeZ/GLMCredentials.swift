/// The Z.ai key behind a GLM Coding Plan, borrowed from whichever tool holds
/// it.
///
/// Z.ai does not ship a desktop app for the plan, so there is no single
/// session to borrow the way Claude Code's or Cursor's is borrowed. What it
/// has is an API key that several coding tools will hold on the user's behalf,
/// and a notch that wants to read one of them rather than ask for a key of its
/// own. The sources, in the order they are tried:
///
/// 1. **Claude Code** — `~/.claude/settings.json`, the documented way to point
///    Claude Code at the plan. Only claimed when the base URL alongside the
///    token is a Z.ai one: `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` aimed at api.anthropic.com
///    is somebody's Anthropic key, and claiming it would read the wrong
///    account and report it under GLM's name.
/// 2. **ZCode** — two files. `~/.zcode/v2/config.json` is where a plan key is
///    pasted in directly: an enabled `builtin:*-coding-plan` entry with a
///    plaintext `apiKey`, and the `baseURL` beside it says which console the
///    key belongs to. `~/.zcode/v2/credentials.json` holds the token from
///    signing into the plan through the app instead; recent builds encrypt it
///    at rest behind an `enc:v1:` marker, and those are skipped rather than
///    guessed at — decrypting them is ZCode's business, and a wrong guess
///    would read as a signed-out plan.
/// 3. **OpenCode** — `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`, keyed under a
///    handful of provider names for the global (`z.ai`) and China
///    (`bigmodel.cn`) consoles.
